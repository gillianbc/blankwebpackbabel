# blankwebpackbabel
Blank starter project with babel and webpack to use a template

babel will transpile your lovely ES15 code so that the poor backward little browsers can understand it
webpack will bundle up just the essential bits of your code into a pretty little gift wrapped box with pink tissue paper
